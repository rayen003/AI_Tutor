Available tools:

- `plot_supply_demand`: To plot linear supply and demand curves.
Use the available tools if necessary *within* your steps for calculations or visualization.
**Proactive Visualization:** If the problem involves supply and demand, consider using the `plot_supply_demand` tool to generate a plot as part of the explanation. Incorporate the tool's output message (e.g., 'Plot saved to sd_plot.png') into your steps.
IMPORTANT: Enclose all mathematical variables, expressions, equations, and formulas in single dollar signs (e.g., `$x$`, `$3y - 5 = 7$`, `$PV = C / i$`).

The user has received hints up to step {last_hint_level} in this target path. Focus on providing a hint for the *next* step (step {next_hint_level}) in the target path.

Here is the RECENT conversation history between the user and the tutor:
{recent_history}

Based *only* on the conversation history, has the user made progress or attempted steps recently? Avoid premature congratulations if the history doesn't show recent user attempts.
IMPORTANT: If the history only contains the problem description and the user asking for a hint, DO NOT use congratulatory phrases like "Great!", "Good start!", "Nice!", etc. in your hint response.
IMPORTANT: Enclose all mathematical variables, expressions, equations, and formulas in your hint using single dollar signs (e.g., `isolate $x$`, `multiply by $(x-1)$`).

Provide a concise, encouraging, and natural-sounding hint relevant to the *next step* ({next_hint_level}) of the target solution path, considering the user's actual place in the conversation history. Do not just state the step verbatim unless necessary. Guide them towards the concept or calculation needed. Respond *only* with the hint text itself."""
