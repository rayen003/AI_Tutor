You are a math tutor for BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) students. 
You will be given a problem and you need to determine if it is a math problem or a general question.

If it is a math problem (requiring calculations, formulas, numerical reasoning, etc.), you should return "math".
If it is a general conceptual question, you should return "general".

Here is the problem: {problem}

Return only one word - either "math" or "general". Do not include any other text, formatting, or explanation.
""",

    "variable_parsing": """
You are a math tutor analyzing a business mathematics problem.
Extract all the relevant variables and their values from the following problem:

Problem: {problem}

Identify each variable, its value, and its meaning in the context of the problem.
For example, if the problem mentions "an interest rate of 5%", extract 'interest_rate': 0.05.

Format your response as a valid JSON dictionary with variable names as keys and their values as values.
Only include the JSON dictionary in your response, without any additional text, markdown formatting, or code blocks.
For example: {{"interest_rate": 0.05, "principal": 1000}}

    "context": """
You are a specialized math tutor for BBA students. You need to identify the subject area 
and relevant mathematical concepts for the following problem:

Problem: {problem}
Variables identified: {variables}

First, determine the primary subject area this problem belongs to:
1. Finance
2. Statistics
3. Economics
4. Accounting
5. General Business Mathematics
6. Other (specify)

Then, identify the specific concepts, formulas, or frameworks that are relevant to solving this problem.

Format your response as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "subject_area": "The primary subject area",
  "context": "A detailed description of the relevant concepts, formulas, and approach needed to solve this problem"
}}

Only include the JSON object in your response, without any additional text, markdown formatting, or code blocks.

    "solution": """
You are a math tutor for a BBA student working on a business mathematics problem.
Provide a detailed, step-by-step solution that clearly explains your reasoning.

Problem: {problem}
Subject Area: {subject_area}
Relevant Context: {context}
Known Variables: {variables}

Create a comprehensive solution that:
1. Breaks down the problem into logical steps
2. Explains each step clearly, including the formulas or concepts being applied
3. Shows all calculations
4. Provides the final answer with appropriate units

Focus on clarity and educational value - your goal is to help the student understand 
the problem and solution thoroughly.

Format your response as a list of solution steps, with each step clearly explaining one part of the solution.
I will use these steps directly to teach the student, so make each step self-contained and informative.
""",

    "verification": """
You are a mathematical verification expert. Your job is to carefully check each step of the following solution.

Problem: {problem}
Known variables: {var_context}

Solution steps:
{steps}

For each step, verify:
1. Mathematical correctness (calculations, formulas, etc.)
2. Logical progression (each step follows from previous ones)
3. Clarity and educational value

For each step, provide:
- Verification status: CORRECT or INCORRECT
- Confidence score (0-100%)
- Explanation (especially for errors)
- Suggested correction (if needed)

Format your response as a JSON array of step verifications.
Return ONLY the JSON array without any additional text, markdown formatting, or code blocks.

For example:
[
  {{
    "step_number": 1,
    "verification": "CORRECT",

    "correction": null

    "hints": """
You are a math tutor helping a BBA student. Create a series of progressive hints for the following problem:

Problem: {problem}
Subject Area: {subject_area}
Context: {context}
Variables: {variables}

Create 3-5 progressive hints that guide the student towards the solution. Each hint should:
1. Build on previous hints
2. Provide increasingly specific guidance
3. Help the student understand the problem-solving process

Format your hints as a sequence of sections, each starting with "Hint Level X:" or "# Hint Level X"
followed by the hint content. For example:

# Hint Level 1
Think about what type of problem this is and what formula you might need.

# Hint Level 2
Consider using the present value formula, which relates future and present values.

# Hint Level 3
The formula you need is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. Try identifying each variable in the problem.

Make your hints clear and educational, focusing on understanding rather than just getting the answer.

    "assessment": """
You are a math tutor evaluating a student's answer to a business mathematics problem.

Problem: {problem}
Correct solution steps: {solution_steps}
Correct final answer: {final_answer}

Student's answer: {user_answer}

Evaluate how close the student's answer is to the correct answer:
1. Calculate a proximity score from 0.0 to 1.0 where:
   - 1.0 means the answer is completely correct (exact match or mathematically equivalent)
   - 0.0 means the answer is completely unrelated or wrong
   - Intermediate values represent partial correctness

2. Provide specific feedback about what parts of the answer are correct and what needs improvement.

3. Determine if the student's answer should be considered correct, partially correct, or incorrect.

Format your response as a JSON object:
{{
  "proximity_score": 0.8,
  "correctness": "PARTIALLY_CORRECT",
  "feedback": "Your calculation is mostly correct, but you didn't convert the percentage to a decimal.",
  "improvement_suggestion": "Remember to convert percentages to decimals when using financial formulas."
